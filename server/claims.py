"""Does a sentence make a factual claim that ought to have a source?

A rule-based check, used only for sentences nothing in the reading supports, so the person
can see where their writing needs more research. Deliberately cheap and transparent rather
than another model call: it looks for figures, research language and cause-and-effect
wording, and ignores opinion and signposting. It will miss some claims and occasionally
flag a sentence that doesn't need a source.
