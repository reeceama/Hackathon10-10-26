# Builds the downloadable Referee for Mac: one app with its own Python, Referee's code and
# libraries, and the browser extension folder inside, so nothing else needs installing.
# Output: macapp/dist/Referee.app, Referee-mac.zip (Apple silicon) and Referee-extension.zip.
#
# Python comes from python-build-standalone (Astral), pinned below and checked against its
# published SHA-256. The app is signed ad hoc, not notarised: the first time it's opened,
# macOS asks for it to be allowed in System Settings > Privacy & Security.
